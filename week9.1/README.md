Chrome doesn't want to display this sketch for some reason. It doesn't show anything, but the sketch still works fine in p5. If you're reeeeeally curious about weather data in this town, copy the sketch to p5 and run it (or just don't use Chrome.)


The text itself also carries the color of the humidity gradient between green and blue. We're not a very wet town, so chances are it's not that humid. The rest is explained in-sketch.
