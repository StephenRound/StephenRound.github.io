For my final project, I'd like to improve the sword code I wrote earlier this semester, adding 3D elements and creating a sort of Windows 96 screensaver aesthetic. If I get really ambitious, I'll add an initial input for number of swords created.

One vision I have is maintaining the spinning blades but adding a 3D rotation element, so it's sword of an atom with swords orbiting a center from all axes.

The obvious example: stephenround.github.io/week6.1/

The first problem is already solved--I have the 2D edition already made. The big obstacle to overcome is the 3Dtizing of the whole project. I'll begin with making the sword objects 3D, then worry about how to make each set of swords generate around the Y axis.

Week 1: 3Dtize the swords

Week 2: Make the sword sets rotate

Week 3: Put it all together, add input if there's time.
