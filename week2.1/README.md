This was a little bit easier than the first assignment, admittedly. Playing around with the random function and variables and seeing what came of it was fun. For this sketch, I made a simple circle that follows and expands depending on mouse movement, while a triangle and a capsule shape dance wildly to the left. These shapes are both independent of mouse movement and are different each time.
