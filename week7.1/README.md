Sorry, I'm sorry. Let me start again.

Easily one of the most frustrating things I've ever had to do in college, this is what I'm turning in. After what feels like an infinite number of unsuccessful tries, I just studied the example code, to see what I could be missing. From there, I took pieces of it to patch up my code and made sure to study what each piece did. 

There was some interesting functions that frankly, I could have never found out on my own. .slice() takes a piece of an array and ignores the rest, effectively creating a new array, .concat() combines two arrays into a new one. (Concatenate -- computer lingo that means to link together.)

A do/while loop as opposed to a while loop confused me, but after switching it around I figured out a while loop is only telling it to do something after checking if it's still fulfilling the while condition, while the do/while loop tells it to do the thing while its conditions are met. If that makes any sense.


After making the cardinals actually work based on the literal word for the direction, I had a little (enormous) celebration.

The pacmen seem to leave the canvas when they reach the south side but eventually they come back. They also sometimes ignore stopping when they hit another pacman. They also sometimes snap towards a wall or to where they would end up. But all things considered, I'm just happy with what I got, and just happy that it's done with.
