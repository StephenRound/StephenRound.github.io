For this week's assignment, I used the sketch we used in class (the one with the migrating circles) and tweaked it a little bit as the base. From there, I needed a click element and a mouse following element.

I did something simple for the click element--a background change. The background being redrawn happens to also erase all the chaotic shapes created by the mouse and for loops, so it ends up being handy. The color is as random as the colors of the shapes.

The rectangle that follows your mouse grows and stretches according to your position, and leaves behind a trail of previous ones, similiar to a paintbrush.

The circles still migrate like before, but the change I made during class was to make the stroke a random shade of purple. The effect was really cool, but I took it a step further and made a more random selection, now creating pipes that have shades of purple, blue, pink, and sometimes gray in them. I added a fill with the same parameters, as the white fill before didn't really blend with the rest of the sketch. This color randomness translated to the rectangles as well, which wasn't intentional at first, but it worked out pretty well.
